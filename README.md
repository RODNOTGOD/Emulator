# Project: Emulation #

## Schedule ##

### Week 1 ###

  Build all basic gates: not, and, or, xor. Start looking into how to connect
  all the parts with each other i.e. wires or just pass into other functions

  - [X] Decoder
  - [X] NOT
  - [X] AND
  - [X] OR
  - [ ] XOR

### Week 2 ###

  Start focusing all major components of the CPU. And finalizing the connection
  of the basic chips.

  - [ ] Registers(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
  - [ ] Stack pointer
  - [ ] Instruction pointer
  - [ ] mux/demux

### Week 3 ###

  Build memory components and connecting memory to the major components and
  enabling immediate addressing of memory locations in opcodes

  - [ ] EPROM
  - [X] Memory
  - [ ] JMP
  - [ ] CMP
  - [ ] NOP
  - [ ] ADDC
  - [ ] SUBB
  - [ ] FLAGS

### Week 4 ###

  Finish building of the circuit. Finalize all actions and left over to clean
  up.
